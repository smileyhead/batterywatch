**BatteryWatch** is a sleek, modern KDE Plasma 6 widget designed to monitor your device's power ecosystem. Keep track of battery levels for your Bluetooth or wireless devices, like headphones, mouse, keyboard, and game controllers, all from a single, beautiful interface right there in your tray bar!

## Features

*   **Unified Monitoring**: See the battery status of all connected devices in one place.
*   **Smart Display**: A minimal tray icon that expands into a detailed list when clicked, and automatically hides when no devices are connected - no wasted space when nothing to show.
*   **Bluetooth Control**: Disconnect Bluetooth devices directly from the widget.
*   **Customizable Visibility**: Easily hide or show specific devices from the system tray to keep your workspace clutter-free.
